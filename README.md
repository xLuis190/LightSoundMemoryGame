## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
The only resource i used for this game was the tutorial page, i tried making the game my own but failed.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? 
One challenge that I had is I was trying to create the game by myself from scratch with no help, so I got the four buttons and they were lighting them up but after that, I wanted to put the cue inside of a for loop so that it runs in a sequence, but when I did it it was playing two colors instead of one and by removing the for loop it went back to just playing one. What I did to solve this was to look at the tutorial website and it helped me a lot, especially the playClueSequence function.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? 
I haven't been doing web development that often since in my school I have been focussing on Python and C++. But if I get hired will I be doing web development? Will I learn new technologies like React, Vue.Js? I wish to discover new ways in which things can be done. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. 
I would probably make 2 players compete, i added the difficulty levels which makes the pattern random and increase the length in the pattern depending on the difficulty. 
Also would like to animate each of the buttons
